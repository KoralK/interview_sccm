Transcript:
(00:00) foreign from mind magix and today I welcome you all to this amazing video on SCCM interview questions okay so sscm basically stands for system center configuration manager and it is developed by Microsoft and is used to manage this system servers of an organization that consists of a huge number of computers that work on various operating systems in this particular video we have divided the number of questions into four categories so the first category of questions is for pressures the second category of questions is for experienced candidates
(00:46) after this you have questions for the administrator and the fourth set of question is for the patch management okay so guys this is the agenda for this particular video so without any further delay let's get started the first category of questions is for the freshers so these are relatively easy questions okay and the first question over here is what do you mean by SCCM system center configuration manager or sscm is a software management group that is developed and designed by Microsoft okay so it allows the user to manage the
(01:19) computer systems that run on various operating systems such as Windows Linux and Mac operating system so SCCM is also known as config manager so this was a quick definition of SCCM the next question is what are the essential features of sccn Okay so the essential and important features of sccmr as you can see on the screen desired configuration management asset tracking deployment of operating systems reporting software deployment remote control and Patch management the next question is list out the various types
(01:55) of sites that are available in sscm okay so guys there are various types of sites that are available in SCCM such as primary site Central Administration side and secondary side so guys the next question is based on previous question so the question says what is the central Administration site or Cas okay so the central Administration site or Cas is a top level site in the order Sid supports only primary sites as a child site it is used to manage all the clients in the hierarchy and to perform all site management tasks from the console to
(02:33) connect with the cas the next question is what is the difference between primary site and secondary site okay so guys whenever you're asked such kind of questions in the actual interview as well like difference between so and so so what you can do is you can grab a piece of paper and on that paper what you can do is you can make two columns one for the primary site and the second one for the second result okay and in those two columns you can mention the points of differentiation okay so as you can see here for the primary side it can be
(03:05) accessed with Microsoft SQL database whereas the secondary site cannot access the Microsoft SQL database or the SQL Server okay so in case of primary side it can administer through the configuration manager console and the secondary site can only administer through the primary side okay so this was the second point after this the primary site can be used as a child of another primary site or it can have its own child sites whereas in case of secondary site it cannot be used as a child of its own and the last point over
(03:42) here is clients can assign the sites directly in case of primary sites and in case of secondary sites clients cannot assign this site directly so guys the next question is Define the child site in SCCM so the child site is a site that provides a structure and gets all of the data from a higher level site so this was a quick definition of child side the next question is why do we use bits in SCCM so guys bits basically stands for background intelligence transfer service so it is basically used to transfer the data
(04:17) between the secm server and the client so it is even used to download the client to the machine when we start the client push the next question is Define sup okay so sup or software update is the site system role that is used to create on the server when the wsus has been installed so the sup and WS us combined with one another to build this software update backgrounds and demand for these software updates metadata the next question is what is wsus and why do we use it so guys wsus basically stands for Windows server update service so it is
(04:58) used to deploy the existing updates in the product to systems that execute the Windows operating system the next question is Define SMS providers in SCCM so the SMS provider can be installed on the site database server site server or another server during the configuration manager setup so after the setup has been completed then the current installed location is shown on the site properties General tab the next question is list the various client deployment methods so guys as you can see on the screen these are the
(05:31) various client deployment methods that are available in SCCM so the first one is client post installation after this you have group policy installation manual installation software update Point based installation upgrade installation and logon script installation the next question is list the ports that are used in SCCM so guys as you can see on the screen these are the ports that are used in SCCM the first one is TCP 2701 then you have the default then you have the default https Port 443 after this you have the client
(06:05) to site system HTTP Port 80 and last but not the least you have smb445 the next question is what are the types of the sender in SCCM so guys there are basically two types of senders that are available in SCCM the first one is the standard sender and the second one is The Courier sender the next question is what are the different application detection methods defined in sscn so the different application detection methods that are defined in SCCM are registry custom detection Windows installers and file system the next question is Define
(06:42) the fallback status point in sscm so the fallback status provides the configuration manager clients with the other fallback servers when the client site assignment or installation fails the next question is what is the deployment share in sscm so the deployment share in the CCM is the repository for the application OS image device drivers and the language packs it can be deployed to the Target machines as well the next question is why do we use server locator point in SCCM so server locator points are used in the configuration manager to complete
(07:22) the client-site assignment on an intranet and help clients to find management points when they cannot find the information through the active directory domain Services the next question is mention some of the important site system roles in secl so guys as you can see on the screen the important site system roles that are available in secmr distribution Point fallback status Point management Point pxc service Point reporting point server locator Point software update point and state migration point the next question
(07:56) is list the services that are required for the client computer to communicate with the server so guys the following other services that are required for the client machine to communicate with the server as you can see on the screen first you have computer browser then you need SMS agent host then you have wmi then comes the windows installer and last button of the list you require background intelligent transfer service or bits the next question is what is the secm console so sscm console is a tool that is used to perform various tasks
(08:33) such as device management Network management and application deployment the next question is how to take remote control of the client computer using the SCCM console so guys for this what you need to do is you need to open the sscm console and click on all systems collections where the client has been populated after this right click on the client computer and select start and then click on remote tools the next question is mention the tools required for the software update point so the tools that are required for software
(09:06) update points are Windows update agent or wa 3.0 then you require the wsus 3.0 Administration console then comes the network load balancing of the NLB after this you require Windows installer and site server communication to active software update point and you also require background intelligence transfer service or bits so guys with this we have covered the fresher category of questions for SCCM okay so guys now from question number 23 onwards we will be covering a few questions which are meant for the experienced candidates like those
(09:44) candidates who have at least two to three years of experience with secn okay so in this particular category we will be seeing a lot of scenario based questions as well okay so through scenario based questions the interviewer will basically come to know that how much experience or how well are you aware of the SCCM as a tool okay so the next question over here is how to backup sscm server so to backup the scheduled tasks do expand the site maintenance and site setting notes and then what you have to do is you have to click on the specific
(10:17) tasks which you want to backup the next question is how to distribute the package so guys there are a few steps that you need to follow to distribute the package so the first step over here is write an install program regarding the installation sources to create the package in the secm after this to synchronize the contents assign the distribution points to the package after this create a collection including the objects that allow us to receive the packages and the fourth step is creating an advertisement for the distribution to
(10:50) link with the collection or to decide either an advertisement is required or not the next question is what are the new features in the release of sccm1806 so in the release of sscm1806 there are a lot of amazing features such as site server High availability CM pivot enabling distribution points to use Network congestion control enhanced HTTP site system downloading content from a CMG improved ws2s maintenance and phase deployment of applications the next question is how to connect the SCCM site server so guys to
(11:31) connect with the sscm site server you need to follow a few steps such as click on Powershell and then select run as Administration after this enter the command and click enter after this enter the command that you want and then run the code now enter the site code to enable the connection the next question is Define itmu so guys itmu is the inventory tool for Microsoft updates for SMS 2003 and onwards the next question is what is the latest version of SCCM so the latest version of secm is the endpoint configuration manager
(12:11) which was released in December 2022 the next question is what are the features of the latest version of sscm so the important features of the latest version of SCCM are application management real-time management Microsoft end point manager tenant attach desktop analytics site infrastructure client management and content management as well the next question is what are all unknown computers collections so the all unknown computers collection includes two objects that Define the records in the configuration manager
(12:45) so we can deploy the operating system that is not managed by the configuration manager so these computers consist of the system where the configuration manager client is not installed the system is not identified by the configuration manager and the system is not imported within the configuration manager the next question is Define the Azure active directory device identity in sccm1806 so the Azure active directory device identity is a cloud-based identity that is used to secure the data with a management point and a cloud
(13:21) management Gateway the next question is what is internet based client management so internet based client management enables us to control the configuration manager of clients when they are not connected to the network of a system but has a standard network connection the next question is Define the software metering in configuration managing so the software metering in SCCM is used to Monitor and collect the clients software data usage of their configuration managers the next important question over here is
(13:55) differentiate between native mode and mixed mode in SEC okay so guys as we have discussed earlier like in the questions where you are asked differentiate between so and so grab a piece of paper make two columns one for Native mode and one for mix mode and highlight the points under those respective columns so if you talk about Native mode so the negative mode is used for encryption and authentication with the use of Standard Security protocols in case of mixed mode it is used to place the default clients management
(14:27) points if you talk about Native mode it can integrate with the pki or the public key infrastructure whereas in case of mixed mode it cannot be integrated with pki or public key infrastructure the next question is mention the types of Discovery methods that are available in SCCM so the different types of Discovery methods that are available in sscm are as you can see on the screen active directory system Discovery active directory Security Group Discovery active directory user Discovery network discovery Forest Discovery and Hardware
(15:03) discovery the next question is what are the boundaries in SCCM console and what are the types of boundaries that are available in SCCM so boundaries are the network locations that include devices that are required to manage the system so if you talk about different types of boundaries is necessium so here you have IP subnet IP ranges IPv6 prefix and active directory side the next question is differentiate between package update and package refresh so in case of package update it is used when the user made some changes
(15:36) in the source file if you talk about package refresh so it is used to refresh a particular file in case of package update it can update the packaged version in the SQL whereas package refresh can revise the old files if you talk about package update so a new pck file is used for other new DPS whereas in case of package refresh no new pck files were sent the last point over here is in case of package update it is a compressed package but it can be corrupt as well in case of package refresh it creates a compressed file
(16:12) when we try to update the file itself the next question is Define the deployment type in sscm so the deployment type consists of the identified and application installation documents so it defines how the layout executive helps to deploy the application so it's framework and regulations depend on the software installation in the system the next question is Define active directory Forest Discovery so the active directory Forest Discovery creates boundaries for every site and subdate from the forests automatically it
(16:49) creates the active directory or IP subnet boundaries that are within the discovered active directory Forest the next question is what is the use of schema extension in SCCM so the schema extension in sscm is used to distribute the configuration manager 2012 information to the active directory the next question is Define management point in sscm the management Point represents a primary point of contact between the clients and the server so it can provide the installation rudiments announcement and the source file location for the
(17:24) software distribution package the next question is Define limiting collection so the complete collection has to be restricted with some other collection in the system center to 2012 configuration manager the user has to maintain the limited collection while creating the collection the next question is why do we use wsus so the Ws us enables the administrator to deploy the new Microsoft product update to the systems that are running on the Windows operating system the next question is an interesting and a very important
(17:58) question so the question says how to make an application deployment optional instead of mandatory so to make an application deployment optional configure the deployment reason as available in an application deployment type after this the available applications displayed in the application catalog where the users can install them the next question is Define the site server so the site server defines the system on which the user is installing the configuration manager it basically provides the services that are required
(18:31) for the configuration manager the next question is Define site system and its role in secm so the site system is a system that is used to support the versions of Windows and it can be shared file that hosts several site systems so the role of a site system is the function required to use the features of configuration manager the next question is is it possible to deploy applications using task sequences so the answer to this question is yes it is possible to deploy the applications with the use of task sequences the next question is how
(19:09) to install configuration manager using client push installation wizard so to install the configuration manager by using the client post installation wizard the administrative user must contain at least the modify resource permission the next question is Define the term device in SCCM 2012 so the term device in SCCM 2012 applies to the system or mobile devices such as Windows mobile phone the next question is what is the use of software Center in SCCM 2019 so the software Center is used to replace the notifications with the
(19:46) dialog window and it even configures the user device affinity and default views so guys with this we have covered the questions which were meant for the experience candidates okay so guys now question number 51 onwards we will be covering a few questions which are related to the SCCM administrator okay so the next question over here is why do we use the cloud management dashboard the cloud management dashboard basically provides a centralized view of the cloud management Gateway usage so it consists of the CMG analyzer that connects to the
(20:22) troubleshooting cases in real time the next question is Define inventory in SCCM so the inventory provides system information such as operating system processor type and applications so guys there are basically two types of inventory in sscm the first one is the hardware inventory so it takes the information about the client's Hardware configuration of an organization and the second one is a software inventory so it collects the files from the client machine and stores them on the website server the next question is Define
(20:55) decline policy so the client policy is defined as how the configuration manager clients download the client policy and what are the contents of the client policy so it has information related to mobile devices systems that run on Linux or Unix then Windows operating systems such as servers laptops desktops and Mac operating system computers the next question is what is database replication so the database replication uses the MySQL server to transfer the data for configurations and settings to other sites that are present in the
(21:33) hierarchy of configuration manager the next question is Define asset tracking so asset tracking is defined as a system that requires tracking the updates or packages so it is usually done when the system is created with the necessary operating system the next question is Define asset intelligence in SCCM so asset intelligence enables the administrator to use the management software and inventory with the help of configuration manager hierarchy the next question is what are the uses of State migration points in sscn so the state
(22:10) migration point is used to backup and it migrates the user States so it uses the sequence of tasks to capture and restore the user State data in operating system deployment the next question is Define network access protection in SCCM so the network access protection or nap is a new feature of the Windows Server release so guys it is basically a mechanism that enables the administrator to configure the policy that controls the network accuses until that client system meets the requirement of the security the next question is what is
(22:49) data protection manager so data protection manager is used when SCCM finds faults in the machine so it helps to recover the data from the backup that holds the server file system exchange databases SharePoint data SQL databases and so on the next question is explain the reporting service point so the reporting service point is a method of integrating SQL Server reporting service that is used for managing and creating the configuration Management Service point guys the next question is Define reporting in SCCM so the sscm provides
(23:26) the integration with the report generating tool it generates reports as per bill it generates the reports as per the administrator's requirements and these reports basically include inventory report standard configuration report and reports of the systems having missed the updates the next question over here is explain the internet plan so internet client is the component of the secm tool so it basically allows the users to access the remote systems remotely or mobile devices without using the VPN network
(24:02) the next question is a very important question Define w o l so wol or Wake On LAN is a feature on which the SCCM sends the wake up transmission packets to clients for a specific task sequence or a deployment to execute the next question is what is the use of global condition option the global condition option application deployment to have a granular control over the deployment so it is even used to avoid the issues that are faced in the deployment process the next question is is it possible to change the secondary site to primary
(24:40) site so the answer to this question is no it is not possible to change the secondary site to primary cell so changing moving or upgrading the site is not possible without reinstalling and deleting the process so if you basically change the site it may lose the complete swipe data the next question is do all collections support the incremental updates so the answer to this question is no a few classes of collection that use the query rules regarding the configuration is not supported by incremental updates the
(25:13) next question is can the members of other collections be excluded or included in the collection so the answer to this question is yes in the 2012 configuration manager it has a new set of rules that allows to exclude or include the collection rules so these rules provide for exclusion or inclusion of the collections that have a membership anywhere the next question is does SCCM support 64-bit operating systems so the answer is yes the secm console Works in a 32-bit OS and it can even support the 64-bit OS of the
(25:47) windows version the next question is explain file based replication so file based replication uses the SMB protocol to transfer file based data such as packages and application so there are two options to control first one is the network bandwidth when transferring the data to the site using pulse mode and is limited to maximum transfer rates by an R the next question is Define the client's cache so the configure manager client maintains the client's cash on the Windows system to store the temporary files that are used in the
(26:21) application installation process so the standard size of the client cache is 5120mb the next question is which log file is referred for client installation so ccm.log file on the SMS site server located in the SMS slash logs folder so on the client computer you have to review the CCM setup.log and client and the client dot msi.
(26:50) log file located in the windows directory system 32 CCM setup folder the next question is explain the enhanced HTTP site system in client management so the enhanced HTTP site system develops the way that clients communicate with the site systems so this pre-release feature is not able for new users to use the certificates of the configuration manager to access the HTTP site systems the next question is can users request application so the answer is yes the user can browse the list of the software available in the application catalog so
(27:29) users can request the application that if approved the user can install on the system the next question is what is the application in secl so in secm the application includes the application catalog information and administrative details required to deploy the software package or update to the system or the mobile device the next question is what is the secondary site so secondary site is the alternative side used for distribution and controls the content for the client Network that is located in the remote location
(28:04) so the network links are limited with bandwidth the next question is Define DDR so guys DDR or Discovery data records specify the type of resource resource properties the discovery process site that discovered the resources so the configuration manager provides the library functions that help to create our own DDR the next question is how to create a data Discovery record or a DDR so guys there are a few steps that you must follow to create the DDR so the first step is create a new instance of the SMS resident class after this create a
(28:45) new DDR using the new DDR method in the third step you have to add the properties to the DDR using the add drop methods and finally you have to write the new DDR to a file using the DDR write method the next question is Define heartbeat discovery so Hardware Discovery is used by the active configuration manager clients to update the Discovery Records in the database so because an active client initiates the hardware discovery and it does not discover the new resources so guys with this we have covered the administrator questions for
(29:22) SCCM and now question number 79 onwards we will be covering the fourth category which is SCCM patch management interview questions so the next question over here is what is imtu patch management so the secm customer can scan using the Windows update agent or wqa so wsus is used as a scan inventory which is considered as a system update with imdu patch management you can download only the required updates and in domestic wsus security updates are defined and then the user can install non-security updates as well
(29:59) the position of the patch installment is added to the Real Time by estate messages the next question is how to update deploy software so guys there are a few steps that you must follow to update the deploy software first choose a group of software updates by the SCCM console to track the groups then the updates are installed the next step is automatic installation rules were arranged for automatic software updates installation the third step is when a rule is running and on a separate basis the software gets updated
(30:33) so they are attached to the updated software list and finally in the customer system the updated software is installed the next question is what is the use of dotnet 4.7 in the configuration manager so guys to improve the console accessibility .net 4.7 is used in the configuration manager the next question is what are the features that can migrate to secm 2012 from the configuration manager 2007.
(31:02) so there are a few features that can migrate from configuration manager 2007 to secm 2012 and those features are virtual application packages package Distributing softwares Collections and boundaries configuration baselines configuration items software update deployment templates and task sequences the next question is is it possible to have a similar name for the task sequence so the answer is yes the user can reuse a similar name for the task sequence and it is not mandatory to have a unique name for the task sequence the next question is how to check the
(31:40) server version of SCCM check the server version of sscm open the SCCM console after this select the active configuration manager from the top left hand side icon the next question is what is the estimated size of individual DDR so the estimated size of the individual DDR is one kilobyte the next question is what are the installation methods present in SCCM 2012 so yes there are a few installation methods that are present in SCCM 2012 such as login script grouping policy software based update and image based update the next
(32:17) question is what is the use of InTune so intium is used to handle mobile devices and to maintain the windows and several mobile devices so InTune is also called a cloud-based service and is used for the several purposes such as to handle the mobile devices to enter the details of an organization next to record the details of an organization which are safe and sound to maintain the devices that are exterior to the organization's web and to maintain all of the mobile applications and last but not the least
(32:50) to install Windows appliances to use the autopilot Services the next question is what is the use of distribution point so by using the distribution point the customer can download new operating system then it can connect with a distribution point on the location so the customer can generate boundaries by placing distribution points the next question is what is cloud management dashboard so the dashboard provides a centralized view of the cloud management usage of a Gateway so it includes the connection analyzed to help real-time
(33:23) troubleshooting verification the next question is what are the required CMD legs for the read-only mode so the required CMD lets for the read-only mode are as you can see on the screen set add server settings get active sync device statistics get active sync device get active sync organization settings then you have get active sync mailbox policy after this you have get recipient and you also have get Exchange Server the next question is Define the Content Library so the Content Library is a single stock example of the content for the
(34:01) arrangements to reduce and manage the size of a Content structure for the alarm the Content Library stocks all of the files for installation of the software like updating the applications installing of operating systems and softwares so the site manages and generates the Content Library on every site the executives attach the files of the content to the site server to alert the marks to confirm the content is available in the library or not it connects the left content file with the application so layout executives are not print if the
(34:38) content is already present the next question is how to speed up the software advertisement by forcing policy retrieval and evaluation cycle so to speed up the software advertisement open the control panel and click on configuration manager so configuration manager window opens up to initiate the machine policy retrieval and valuation cycle after this you have to click on the initiate action the next question is how many default management a website can have so user can configure the number of management points in this
(35:10) site but only one of them can be deferred management to configure so to have more default management points the user configures the number of management points to the network load balancing cluster the next question is what is the use of defining the boundary groups so the boundary group is used to find the primary site for clients in case of an automatic site assignment so it even tells the client regarding their management point and their location as well the next question is which log file records activities about
(35:43) task sequences smsts.log file is used to record the task sequence activities the next question is what are the packages that can be distributed through wsus or itmu so there are a few packages that can be distributed through wsus or idmu and those packages are as you can see on the screen critical updates patches and software updates update roller hot fixes and all of the Microsoft packages the next question is Define SMS executive the SMS executive is a service that hosts a process for the thread components so it can monitor the service
(36:23) component log file which is SMS exec.log the next question is does a secondary site have a child sign so the answer to this question is no the secondary site cannot have a child sign or a primary sign because the secondary sites are always the child side poor primary side so guys with this we have come to the end of this session on SCCM interview questions I hope you guys have enjoyed this session if at all you have any queries or doubts related to this session then you can write them in the comment section and my team is here to
(36:56) help you with resolving all your doubts and queries so guys I wish you all the very best for your upcoming interview and thank you for being with us foreign
